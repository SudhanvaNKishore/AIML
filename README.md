# KNN and Regression Analysis with Datasets

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Regression Analysis algorithms using various datasets. KNN is a simple, yet powerful algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, while Regression Analysis is employed to understand relationships between variables.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of how KNN and Regression Analysis algorithms can be applied to real-world datasets. By exploring different datasets and applying these algorithms, users can gain insights into their predictive capabilities and understand their strengths and limitations.

## Features
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implementations for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Regression Analysis:** Demonstrations of linear and non-linear regression techniques.
- **Dataset Exploration:** Utilization of diverse datasets to showcase algorithm performance across various domains.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Calculation of relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, etc.
